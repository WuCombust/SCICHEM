**SCICHEM 3.1**  

SCICHEM 3.1 is a reactive puff model that can be used to calculate single or multi-source impacts of emissions at downwind locations. The model can be used for both short-range calculations (for example, 1-hour SO2, 1-hour NO2, 24-hour secondary PM2.5, or 8-hour ozone concentrations at fenceline receptors, or long-range calculations for primary and secondary pollutant impacts. For 1-hour NO2 applications, the model uses an optimized near-source NO-NO2-O3 chemistry scheme. For long-range applications or near-field PM2.5/ozone, the full chemistry option can be used to calculate downwind ozone and PM2.5 concentrations.
